###Separable Convolution by CUDA and TVM
CUDA and TVM code for separable convolution (depthwise convolution + 1x1 convolution).

####Mar 2018
TVM scheduler for normal convolution with the tensor layout in the form of NHWC, currently missing in the TVM repository.    
Improved runtime of TVMâ€™s depthwise convolution scheduler by replacing filter-reuse with input-reuse.
