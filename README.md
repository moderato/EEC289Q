### Separable Convolution by CUDA and TVM
CUDA and TVM code for separable convolution (depthwise convolution + 1x1 convolution).

#### Mar 2018
TVM scheduler for normal convolution with the tensor layout in the form of NHWC, currently missing in the TVM repository.    
Improved runtime of TVMâ€™s depthwise convolution scheduler by replacing filter-reuse with input-reuse.     
#### Nov 2018
Adding simple benchmarks for analyzing bottlenecks of fused and non-fused computation
#### Oct 2019
Reaching 147us over 56x56x112. Expanding to all size.
